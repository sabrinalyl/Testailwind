<h2 style="color: red;">HISTORY <br>WHERE WE COME FROM</h2>
<img src="Hut Life – Official Pizza Hut Blog.jpeg">
<p style="font-size: x-large;">In 1958, two brothers borrowed $600 from their mom to open a pizza place in Wichita, Kansas. They named it Pizza Hut because their sign only had room for eight letters. The restaurant’s popularity grew quickly due to the delicious food and quality service. Today, there are more than 16,000 independently owned and operated Pizza Hut restaurants. Our 100+ franchise partners employ 350,000 team members in over 100 countries.</p>
